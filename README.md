# Template Golang mySQL

I didn't want to use an ORM like "gorm", so I made this template. I think it's important to understand the basics of mySQL and how to use it in Go.
The SQL syntax is pretty crpytic at start, but if you spend some time on the SQL shell, it will be easier to understand and create your own queries.

* go version go1.19.3 linux/amd64
* MySQL 8.0.31-0ubuntu0.22.04.1
